# Phase 1 of Project NutriCheck which helps the user to maintain calories, in short, it is know as the "Nutrition Calculator"
# Here, the user can add his details related to BMI and maintain his calories with food he ate, so that his diet is balanced


==>K-Calc is a website for tracking calorie intake. Users register with basic details and can set a weight goal. The site stores food item details and recommends daily calorie intake. The site uses cookies and a Food API to add and track items

Part 1 of project Nutri-Check for Hackathon Institutional-Level. For Regional, we will develop this project by adding Weather & APIs for detecting the current place location for Nutrition. For National, we will use AI & face detection to recognize user nutrition diets and develop plans<==
